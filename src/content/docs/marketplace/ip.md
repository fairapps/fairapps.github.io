# Intellectual Property Review

The App Fair is committed to respecting and protecting intellectual property rights. To ensure that apps distributed through our marketplace do not infringe on the rights of others, we have established a review process for assessing intellectual property compliance. This page describes our mechanism for reviewing apps for intellectual property infringement prior to distribution.

## 1. Submission Review

When developers submit their apps to the App Fair, they must confirm that their app does not infringe on any intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, or trade secrets. Our team reviews each submission to verify this information and identify any potential issues.

## 2. Intellectual Property Checks

During the review process, we perform the following checks to assess intellectual property compliance:

### 2.1 Copyright

We verify that the app's source code, assets, and content do not contain any unauthorized use of copyrighted material. Developers must provide proper attribution and licensing information for any third-party content used in their apps.

### 2.2 Trademarks

We ensure that the app does not use any trademarks without proper authorization or in a manner that may cause confusion or deception. This includes the app's name, logo, and any other branding elements.

### 2.3 Patents

While we cannot perform a comprehensive patent search, we review the app's functionality to identify any potential patent infringement issues. Developers are responsible for ensuring that their apps do not infringe on any patents.

## 3. Reporting Intellectual Property Infringement

If you believe that an app distributed through the App Fair infringes on your intellectual property rights, please submit a notice of infringement to [copyright@appfair.org](mailto:copyright@appfair.org). Your notice should include:

- A description of the intellectual property right you claim has been infringed.
- A description of where the infringing material is located within the app.
- Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and email address.
- A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by the intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law.
- A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the owner's behalf.
- Your physical or electronic signature.

## 4. Consequences for Infringement

If we determine that an app infringes on intellectual property rights, we will take appropriate action, which may include removing the app from the App Fair and notifying the developer. In cases of repeated or severe infringement, we may suspend or terminate the developer's account.

## 5. Continuous Improvement

We are committed to improving our intellectual property review process and staying up-to-date with relevant laws and regulations. We welcome feedback from our community to help us maintain a marketplace that respects and protects intellectual property rights.

By carefully reviewing apps for intellectual property infringement, we strive to create a trustworthy and compliant app marketplace. If you have any questions or concerns about our intellectual property review process, please feel free to contact us at [copyright@appfair.org](mailto:copyright@appfair.org).
