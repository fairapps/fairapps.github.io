The App Fair Project is a non-profit charitable organization dedicated to the creation of mobile software applications for the public good. The project was founded in 2022 as a worldwide nexus for free apps to be built, distributed, and maintained.

App Fair apps cost nothing and contain no built-in ad-tech or non-consensual tracking technologies. They do not attempt to monetize the attention of the user in any way. They are created from free and open-source software and are funded solely by donations and grants.

Our first project is launching the App Fair app marketplace for the iPhone and iPad in the European Union in 2026 to distribute these community-led applications. The App Fair marketplace app will be used to discover, review, install, and update the apps in our catalog.

  <Card title="Free & Open Source" icon="sourcehut">
    Every App Fair app is fully free and open source. Anyone can inspect the code,
    contribute improvements, or reuse it for the benefit of the wider community.
  </Card>

  <Card title="No Advertisements or Ad-Tech" icon="close">
    App Fair apps never show ads. There is no attention harvesting, no engagement
    manipulation, and no incentive to optimize for clicks instead of users.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Available Everywhere" icon="seti:hex">
    App Fair apps are distributed both through the commercial app stores — the Apple App Store
    and Google Play Store — as well as alternative marketplaces like AltStore and F-Droid.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No In-App Purchases" icon="star">
    App Fair apps do not monetize end users in any way. No subscriptions, no in-app
    purchases, and no paywalls — the full experience is available to everyone.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Digital Public Goods" icon="heart">
    App Fair projects are digital public goods, built by the community and funded by
    donations and grants to serve society.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Privacy-Respecting by Design" icon="approve-check-circle">
    App Fair apps contain no trackers, no spyware, and request no unnecessary permissions.
    Your data stays on your device unless sharing is essential and explicit.
