The App Fair Project is a non-profit charitable organization dedicated to the creation of mobile software applications for the public good. The project was founded in 2022 as a worldwide nexus for free apps to be built, distributed, and maintained.

App Fair apps cost nothing and contain no built-in ad-tech or non-consensual tracking technologies. They do not attempt to monetize the attention of the user in any way. They are created from free and open-source software and are funded solely by donations and grants.

Our first project is launching the App Fair app marketplace for the iPhone and iPad in the European Union in 2026 to distribute these community-led applications. The App Fair marketplace app will be used to discover, review, install, and update the apps in our catalog.
