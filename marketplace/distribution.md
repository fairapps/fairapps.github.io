# Terms of Distribution for Developers

Welcome to the App Fair, a free and open source app marketplace! We're excited to have you on board as a developer. In order to maintain a high-quality and trustworthy platform, we've established some guidelines for distributing apps on our marketplace. Please read the following terms carefully and make sure your apps comply with them.

## 1. Content Guidelines

### 1.1 Legal Compliance

Your app must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where it is available. This includes, but is not limited to, privacy laws, intellectual property laws, and export control laws.

### 1.2 App Content

Apps must not contain or promote any content that is offensive, pornographic, violent, discriminatory, or otherwise inappropriate. App Fair reserves the right to determine what constitutes inappropriate content and to remove any app that violates this policy.

### 1.3 User Privacy

Apps must respect user privacy and only collect, use, and share data with user consent. Developers must provide a clear and accessible privacy policy that explains their data practices.

### 1.4 Intellectual Property

Your app must not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. This includes using copyrighted material, trademarks, or trade secrets without proper authorization.

## 2. Business Model Guidelines

### 2.1 Free and Open Source

Apps submitted to the App Fair must be free and open source, with their source code publicly available under an OSI-approved open source license.

### 2.2 Monetization

Developers may choose to monetize their apps through donations, in-app purchases, or subscriptions, as long as these methods comply with all applicable laws and do not exploit users.

### 2.3 Advertisements

If your app displays advertisements, they must not interfere with the user experience or be deceptive. Apps must also comply with applicable advertising laws and regulations.

## 3. App Submission and Review

### 3.1 Submission Process

To submit your app to the App Fair, please provide the following information:

App name
App description
Link to the app's source code repository
Link to the app's privacy policy (if applicable)
Contact information for the developer

### 3.2 Review Process

The App Fair team will review your submission to ensure it complies with these terms. We reserve the right to reject or remove any app that does not meet our guidelines.

### 3.3 Updates and Maintenance

Developers are responsible for keeping their apps up-to-date and maintaining their functionality. App Fair may remove apps that are no longer maintained or have become incompatible with the platform.

## 4. Acceptance of Terms

By submitting your app to the App Fair, you agree to abide by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not submit your app.
