# App Takedown Request Mechanism

The App Fair Project is committed to maintaining a secure and trustworthy app marketplace. We provide a mechanism to handle governmental and other requests to take down an app from our marketplace on grounds that it is illegal, violates intellectual property rights, or violates the App Fair Project's own terms for apps. This page describes how to submit a takedown request and how we handle such requests.

## 1. Submitting a Takedown Request

To request the removal of an app from the App Fair marketplace, please send an email to [takedown-request@appfair.org](mailto:takedown-request@appfair.org) with the subject line "App Takedown Request." Your email should include the following information:

- Your name, organization (if applicable), and contact information, including your address, telephone number, and email address.
- A clear and detailed explanation of the reason for the takedown request, including any relevant legal or policy violations.
- A description of the app in question, including its name, developer, and a link to its listing on the App Fair marketplace.
- Any supporting documentation or evidence to substantiate your request.
- A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in your request is accurate and that you are authorized to make the request on behalf of the relevant governmental agency, intellectual property owner, or other party.
- Your physical or electronic signature.

## 2. Takedown Request Handling Process

Upon receiving a takedown request, we will take the following steps:

### 2.1 Initial Review

Our team will review the takedown request to determine its validity and assess the alleged violations.

### 2.2 Developer Notification

If we find the takedown request to be valid, we will notify the app developer and provide them with the relevant details of the request. The developer will have an opportunity to respond to the allegations and provide any necessary documentation or evidence to support their position.

### 2.3 Temporary Removal

In some cases, we may temporarily remove the app in question from the App Fair marketplace pending the resolution of the takedown request.

### 2.4 Investigation and Resolution

We will conduct a thorough investigation into the takedown request and work with the relevant parties to reach a resolution. This may involve mediation, legal consultation, or other appropriate measures.

### 2.5 Permanent Removal

If the takedown request is found to be valid, we may permanently remove the app from the App Fair marketplace.

## 3. Counter-Notifications

If an app developer believes that their app was removed due to a mistake or misidentification, they may submit a counter-notification to [takedown-request@appfair.org](mailto:takedown-request@appfair.org). The counter-notification should include:

- The developer's name, address, telephone number, and email address.
- A description of the removed app and its location within the App Fair marketplace before removal.
- A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the developer has a good faith belief that the app was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification.
- A statement that the developer consents to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which their address is located or, if outside the United States, any judicial district in which the App Fair Project is located.
- A statement that the developer will accept service of process from the party who submitted the takedown request or their agent.
- The developer's physical or electronic signature.

Upon receiving a valid counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the takedown request and inform them that the removed app may be reinstated within 10-14 business days, unless we receive notice that a legal action has been filed against the developer.

By providing a mechanism to handle takedown requests, we strive to maintain a marketplace that complies with legal requirements and respects the rights of all parties involved. If you have any questions or concerns about our takedown request process, please feel free to contact us at [takedown-request@appfair.org](mailto:takedown-request@appfair.org).
