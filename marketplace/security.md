# App Security and Malicious Activity Detection

At the App Fair Project, we are committed to maintaining a secure and trustworthy alternative app marketplace. To ensure the integrity of our platform, we engage in ongoing monitoring and detection of fraudulent, malicious, or illegal activity in apps and developers. Our approach combines automated scanning, manual human review, and the inherent security provided by our guarantee that all distributed apps are free and open source.

## 1. Automated Scanning

We use automated scanning tools to analyze app code and detect potential security vulnerabilities, malware, or other malicious components. These tools help us identify and address issues before they can impact users.

## 2. Manual Human Review

In addition to automated scanning, our team conducts manual reviews of apps submitted to the App Fair. These reviews assess the app's functionality, content, and compliance with our Terms of Distribution. This process helps us maintain a high-quality marketplace and identify any potential issues that automated tools may miss.

## 3. Open Source Transparency

One of the key benefits of our free and open source app marketplace is the natural security provided by public code review and scrutiny. By requiring all apps to be open source, we encourage community involvement in identifying and addressing potential security issues or malicious behavior. This transparency helps us maintain a secure and trustworthy platform.

## 4. Reporting Suspicious Activity

We rely on our community to help us identify and address fraudulent, malicious, or illegal activity. If you encounter an app or developer that you believe is engaging in such activity, please report it to us at [security@appfair.org](mailto:security@appfair.org).

## 5. Consequences for Policy Violations

Developers and apps found to be in violation of our policies will face consequences, ranging from warnings to app removal or account suspension. In severe cases, we may also report the activity to law enforcement authorities.

## 6. Continuous Improvement

We are constantly working to improve our fraud and malicious activity detection processes. This includes staying up-to-date with the latest security threats, refining our automated scanning tools, and providing ongoing training for our review team.

By combining automated scanning, manual human review, and the natural security provided by open source transparency, we strive to create a safe and secure app marketplace for all users. If you have any questions or concerns about our fraud and malicious activity detection efforts, please feel free to contact us at [security@appfair.org](mailto:security@appfair.org).
