(This is the second part in the "A Future for iPhone App Stores" series. The first part, at https://appfair.org/blog/a-future-for-app-stores.html, outlines the coming changes to the mobile app marketplaces as a consequence of the EU's Digital Markets Act.)

What makes an app store worthy of trust? The app stores that are provided by the major platform vendors – the Apple App Store for iOS and the Google Play store for Android – have a degree of trustworthiness built into them. After all, since you trust the operating system on which your phone runs and the intimate details contained therein, then it is not a great leap to extend that trust to the vetting of the software that you can install on that device. A platform vendor might argue that based on this implied trust, they ought to be the *only* app store permitted on their devices.

The Digital Markets Act, however, bars gatekeepers from blocking 3rd party app stores for their devices. This includes the venerable Cydia App Store, which opened in 2008 and predates the Apple Apple Store itself, and which was progressively locked out of the platform over subsequent years (lawsuit ongoing). As for who else might open an app store, there is only speculation at this point. One obvious candidate will be Epic Games, who needs to get their mega-hit Fortnite game back on the iPhone after it was disappeared from the App Store in August 2020 due to payment policy infractions. Another obvious candidate will be Amazon, who already runs an Android app store for their Kindle devices, and who would like a channel through which they can distribute their digital media apps on iOS (Kindle, Prime Video, etc) that can perform commerce. 

Aside from Epic and Amazon, who else might want an iPhone app store? Perhaps Meta (née Facebook) and X (née Twitter), both struggling to retain relevance on the platforms that brought them to prominence in the first place. Many dark whispers on internet forums warn of the dire consequences of these players entering the market. But ultimately, if you have already trusted these organizations with your intimate personal details, then you are likely to also trust their judgement in vetting the apps that they re-distribute to you through their app stores. If you don't trust them, then don't install their app store.

But for a non-platform and non-name-brand app store, what criteria exists for trustiness? Say I wanted to make my own app store – let's call it the "App Fair" – that distributes free and open-source software. How is an end-user expected to grant me trust? They trust Amazon because they've already given them their credit card for prior purchases. They trust Apple, because Apple makes the device and operating systems on which they've already trusted their personal details. A sponsor-ee of a protected brand name comes with an implicit degree of trust, both in their initial judgements, as well as their reliability in addressing mishaps, whose ongoing negative consequences might impact other facets of their brand. But for a no-brand, free and open app store with no single accountable figure – why would anyone trust that?

One solution to this problem has been implemented on the Android operating system, in the form of the "F-Droid" app store. Unlike iOS, the Android ecosystem has dozens of app stores – including those by Amazon and Samsung – that can provide a "storefront" app for downloading and installing other apps on the device. The F-Droid store is a non-commercial distribution channel for Android apps sourced from a variety of unaffiliated (and unaccountable) projects. These projects are only lightly vetted in terms of content and quality, but a degree of assurance of the intent of the developer is granted because the F-Droid project itself builds the apps that it distributes from the source code provided by the app project. This means that any ill-intent, such as blatant attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data and other privacy violations that are common with closed-source apps, will be subject to public scrutiny and (hopefully) quickly identified and removed from the catalog. The system works quite well, but releases are bogged down by constant issues with re-building other people's projects, which often requires manual intervention by the project's volunteers. These heroic individuals dive into alien and complex projects to isolate and resolve esoteric build issues every day, but the system is ultimately un-scalable.

Reproducible builds solve this problem. 



(Disclaimer 1: I worked on the Kindle iOS app for Amazon, but that ended in 2011 and I have no subsequent inside insight into Amazon's plans. Disclaimer 2: I was contacted by attorneys representing Epic Games in their 2019 trial to testify on the topic of my Stanza app, but we mutually agreed to not proceed, and I have had no further contact with Epic since then.)



With the announcement of the official Gatekeeper designations under the *Digital Markets Act*, iPhone owners will soon regain the ability to install apps from outside the confines of a single App Store. This capability has been blocked by the platform for years, requiring that owners of an iPhone obtain their software exclusively through a single platform-locked App Store, whose terms and conditions dictate the types of software that can be distributed, and whose rules demand a percentage of all digital commerce transacted through the apps listed therein.

App Store tariffs and regulations have diminished the range and quality of software available to iPhone owners. They are the reason you cannot browse and purchase books from within the Kindle app, and why the massively popular game Fortnite was disappeared from the entire iOS marketplace in August 2020. Furthermore, a gag rule imposed on app developers forbids them from mentioning other avenues of commerce. The Spotify music app's [Premium] tab intimates this with a lone pithy statement: “You can't upgrade to Premium in the app. We know, it's not ideal.”

But by March of 2024 – the date that gatekeepers must be in full compliance and good standing with the rules of the DMA – joyous gamers will again be able to show off their Fortnite dance mojo from the comfort of their iPhones. Consumers will likely be able to browse and buy books from within the Kindle app, purchase a music subscription from within the Spotify app, and pay for goods and services using their preferred digital payment service provider rather than having one imposed by their device's operating system. And the door will finally be open for truly free software to compete on a level playing field alongside commercial vendors.

Lest a gatekeeping entity be tempted to simply ignore these new regulations, or take a creatively self-preferencing interpretation of the provisions, the penalties for violations are hair-raisingly severe: between 4% and 20% of the designated gatekeeper’s total annual turnover. With a quarter-trillion dollars of revenue at stake, and under vigilant public scrutiny, we can expect very careful adherence to the letter of the legislation.

What does compliance look like, exactly? For everyday iPhone users, how will you find and install independently-distributed apps? Will they be listed in a separate section of the "App Store" app, or will they have their own separate app management apps? Or will you need to download apps individually using a web browser? If so, how will app updates be handled? And what about security and privacy and malware and curation and content moderation?

As for the creators of these apps, companies and individuals alike, what will change for them? Can they distribute their apps in multiple marketplaces simultaneously? And which system APIs ("Application Programming Interfaces", the dialects that software components use to communicate with each other and with their host operating system) will be available to developers of independently-distributed apps? Will these apps need to be digitally signed, and if so, who is the signing authority and what standards must these signatures adhere to? Will the prevailing system of special app "entitlements" persist, and if so, who grants these entitlements to supplicants, and what appeal process is available to rejectees? And what about oversight and taxes and piracy and local regulatory compliance?

There are many outstanding questions, and no concrete answers at this time. The picture will clarify itself in the coming weeks and months, as iOS is updated to remove its blocks on installing third-party applications. In addition, the third party app marketplace vendors and aspirants will need official published documentation on the `MobileInstallation` framework APIs that are used by iOS to install and update applications. All of this will need to be available well in advance of the March 6 deadline, as the initial attempts at compliance are likely to be found lacking.

This is the first part in a series leading up to March 6, 2024 that will discuss the changing landscape of mobile software marketplaces, with a focus on free software and digital public goods.
